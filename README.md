BrawlLib / BrawlBox
==========

BrawlLib and BrawlBox are designed to edit various types of data files found in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. They were developed initially by Kryal
(http://code.google.com/p/brawltools/source/list), then by BlackJax96
(http://code.google.com/p/brawltools2) until the end of 2013.

This version of BrawlBox is maintained by libertyernie and Sammi Husky (and includes some contributions from others as well!)
