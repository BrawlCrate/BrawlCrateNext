==========

BrawlLib and BrawlBox were developed initially by Kryal
(http://code.google.com/p/brawltools/source/list), then by BlackJax96
(http://code.google.com/p/brawltools2) until the end of 2013. This repository
was initialized with BlackJax's most recent version, and will contain any
changes I make to BrawlLib or BrawlBox.

Most of the changes here are designed to enable some functionality in my other
programs that use BrawlLib, but a few changes have been made that affect
BrawlBox as well (most notably UTF-8 support in MSBin files.)

Note: on May 3, I edited the repo history to remove .exe/.dll files, so if you
have an old copy you'll need to re-clone.
