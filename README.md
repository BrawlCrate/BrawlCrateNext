==========

BrawlLib and BrawlBox were developed initially by Kryal
(http://code.google.com/p/brawltools/source/list), then by BlackJax96
(http://code.google.com/p/brawltools2) until the end of 2013. This
repository was initialized with BlackJax's most recent version, and
will contain any minor changes I need to make to BrawlLib in order for
my other applications to work. BrawlLib.dll should remain backwards-compatible
with the most recent (Dec. 31) version of BrawlBox.exe, however.
